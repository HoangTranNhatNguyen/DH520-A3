1 Oore upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, wrak end weary,'
Over many a quaiut and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddeoly (here came a tapping,
As of onie one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
" Tie aome visiter," I mutt-red, "tapping at my chamJer door
Only this, and nothing more."
ft Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
. And each separate dying ember wrought its ghot upou the floor,
lieivrly I wished the morrow ; vainly 1 had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow sorro fur the lost Lenore
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Leaore
Nameless here for evermore.
f And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me filled me with fuuiastic terrors never felt before J
So that oow to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating,
Tie some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door
This it is, and nothing more."
4 Present! my soul grew stronger ; hesitating then no longer.
Sir." said 1, " or Madam, truly your forgiveness 1 implore ;
But the fad is I was napping, and so geutly you came rapping.
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door.
That I scarce was sure I heard vou" here I opened wide the dour
Da rliBt-si there, nnd nothing more.
3 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing.
Doubting, dreaming dreams do mortal ever dared to dream before :
Hut the sileuce was unbroken, and the stillness give no token.
And the only word there spoken was the whispered wofJ "Ignore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word "Lenore!"
Merely this, and nothing more.
Baek into my chamber turning all my soul within me burning,
Soon again 1 hesrd a tapping somewhat louder than before. p
Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my window lattice ;
' Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;
Tis the wind, and nothing more !
f Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flatter.
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore :
Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped or stayed he t
Hut with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door
1'crcht d upou a bust of Pallas juvl above my chamber door
Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
8 Tbn this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
Hy the grave and sttro decorum of the countenance it wore,
" Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," said, "art sure no craven.
Ghastly, grim, and ancient Rtvea wandering from the Nightly shore
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore?"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."
8' Much I marveled, this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly.
Though its answer little meaning luile relevancy bore ;
For we can not help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet wsa blessed with setting bird above his chamber door
Bird or beast upou the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
With such name as Nevermore."
!0 B jt the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
. That one word, as if his soul he did in that ou'pour.
Nothing further then he muttered not a feather then he filtered
Till I scarcely more than uttered ' O her friends have flown before'
Oo the morrow he will leave me, as my friend have flowo before."
Then he said, Nevermore."
11 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
Doubtless," said I, " what it utters is its only stock and store
Caught from some un nappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
Followed fast and followed faster until bis soul one burden bore
Till the dirges of bis Hope that melancholy burden bore
Ot Never nevermore. "
12 Rut the Raven still beguiling my sad fancy into smiling.
Straight 1 wheeled a cushioned seal in Iront of bird, and bust, and door,
Then upon the velvet sinking, 1 betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yors
Meant by croaking " Nevermore."
T9 Thus 1 sst engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose hvry eves now burned within my bosom's core ;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining.
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press, ah, nevermore !
ft Then, meihought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swuiij: by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tutted floor.
"Wretch!" 1 cried, " thy God hath lent thet -by these angels he hath sent thee
Respite respite and nepenthe Irom thv memories of Lenore!
Qua!', O quatf this kind nepenthe, and lorget the loft Lenore!"
Quoth the Riven, " Nevermore !"
IS " Prophet!" said h "thing of evil prophet still, if bird or devil f
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore;
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
On this horse by Horror hacnted tell me truly, 1 implore
Is there. i$ there ba'm in Gilead tell me tell me. I implore !"
Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore!'
1 Prophet .'" said I, " thing of evil prophet still, if bird or devil !
By that heaven that bends above us -by that G id we both adore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidden
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore f
Q i-jtb the Raven, "Nevermore.
f 7 "Re that word-our sign of parting, bird or fiend !" I shrieked, upstarting
" Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore 1
Leave no black- plume as a token of that lie thou hast spoken !
Leave my loneliness unbrokeu ! quit the bust above my door !
Take Ihy beak Irom out my heart, and take thy form from off my doof P'
Quoth the Raven, " Nevermore!"
IT And the Riven; never flitting, stiH is sitting, tlill is silting
Oa the pull id bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;'
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him-streaming throws his shadow on the floor !
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted nevermore !
